sooner:
- make config file
- push to sourmash-examples rtfd
- github actions on sourmash examples?

updates:
* example page: add links to categories, related examples.

explore:
- fix favico
- what happens with images?
- comments? link directly, and/or provide count?
- provide tools for reverse linking into external md documents (e.g. sourmash docs)

eventual:
- use jinja2 templating for writing basic pages

refinements -
- link to users with @

ARGUMENTS for using github issues:
- forward and reverse links between issues
- linking between issues in different repositories
- robust commenting on issues
- good auth/moderation/contribution on github
- label API is nice
- markdown formatting is nice

Additional:
- creating conda environment
- limiting search results with include
- sig grep
