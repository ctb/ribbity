# ribbity

tl;dr it's all markdown and we're all friends, why can't we all get along?

Turn a bunch of GitHub issues into a [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site.

For example, turn
[sourmash-bio/sourmash-examples](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash-examples/issues/)
into [this site](http://ctb.github.io/ribbity/).
